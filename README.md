# Stop the Slop

A blog about using AI code generation tools effectively—embracing their power while maintaining quality and intentionality in our work.

## About

Hi, I'm Brendan O'Neill. This blog is about using AI code generation tools effectively—embracing their power while maintaining quality and intentionality in our work.

## What is "Slop"?

"Slop" is low-quality, thoughtless code that gets generated without proper review, testing, or understanding. It's the careless output that happens when developers treat AI tools as magic buttons instead of powerful assistants. Slop clutters codebases, introduces bugs, and creates technical debt.

## The Mission

AI code generation tools are transformative and incredibly useful. The goal isn't to avoid them—it's to use them well. This blog explores strategies for leveraging AI coding assistants while maintaining code quality through proper prompting, thorough testing, meaningful code review, and developer intentionality.

## What You'll Find Here

Practical guides on AI-powered development workflows, effective prompting strategies, testing approaches for AI-generated code, and techniques for reviewing and refining AI output. Everything here is about getting the best results from AI tools without sacrificing quality or understanding.
