# Glide Coders

Standalone tips from a professional developer to help vibecoders minimize dev friction.

## About

Hi, I'm Brendan O'Neill. Glide Coders provides standalone tips from a professional developer to help vibecoders minimize dev friction. Each resource is self-contained and actionable, designed to eliminate friction when starting new projects so you can focus on building instead of configuring.

## What is Vibecoding?

Vibecoding is about finding your flow state—that sweet spot where you're fully engaged, productive, and in the zone. It's coding with intention, clarity, and momentum. But too often, starting a new project means wrestling with setup, configuration, and boilerplate instead of diving into the actual work.

## The Mission

We believe the best code gets written when developers can glide smoothly from idea to implementation. Glide Coders provides standalone tips and resources from a professional developer—each one self-contained and actionable—to help vibecoders eliminate friction at the start of every project, from project scaffolding and configuration to best practices and workflow optimization.

## What You'll Find Here

Standalone tips and practical resources from a professional developer: setup guides, configuration templates, workflow tips, and strategies for maintaining momentum. Each resource is designed to be consumed independently and help you get from zero to productive as quickly as possible, so you can stay in the flow.
