# Glide Coding

Standalone tips from a professional developer to help you practice glidecoding—applying simple but effective coding techniques to minimize friction when coding with AI assistants.

## About

Glide Coding provides standalone tips from a professional developer to help you practice **glidecoding**—applying simple but effective coding techniques to minimize friction when coding with AI assistants.

## What is Glidecoding?

**Glidecoding:** The practice of applying *simple but effective* coding techniques to minimize friction when coding with AI assistants.

Glidecoding is about finding your flow state when working with AI coding assistants—that sweet spot where you're fully engaged, productive, and in the zone. It's coding with intention, clarity, and momentum. But too often, working with AI assistants means wrestling with prompts, context management, and code quality instead of diving into the actual work. Good foundations with solid design patterns make glidecoding easier and enable longer, more effective work sessions.

## The Mission

We believe the best code gets written when developers can glide smoothly from idea to implementation with AI assistants. Glide Coding provides standalone tips and resources from a professional developer—each one self-contained and actionable—to help you practice glidecoding, build solid foundations, eliminate friction when coding with AI, and maintain momentum through proper techniques, design patterns, and workflow optimization.

## What You'll Find Here

Standalone tips and practical resources from a professional developer: techniques for working effectively with AI assistants, setup guides, configuration templates, design patterns, workflow tips, and strategies for building solid foundations. Each resource is designed to be consumed independently and help you establish practices that make glidecoding easier, enabling longer, more effective work sessions when coding with AI.
