# Glide Coders

Standalone tips from a professional developer to help vibecoders minimize dev friction.

## About

Hi, I'm Brendan O'Neill. Glide Coders provides standalone tips from a professional developer to help vibecoders minimize dev friction. Each resource is self-contained and actionable, designed to eliminate friction when starting new projects so you can focus on building instead of configuring.

## What is Vibecoding?

Vibecoding is about finding your flow state—that sweet spot where you're fully engaged, productive, and in the zone. It's coding with intention, clarity, and momentum. But too often, starting a new project means wrestling with setup, configuration, and boilerplate instead of diving into the actual work.

## The Mission

We believe the best code gets written when developers can glide smoothly from idea to implementation. Good foundations with solid design patterns make vibecoding easier and enable longer, more effective work. Glide Coders provides standalone tips and resources from a professional developer—each one self-contained and actionable—to help vibecoders build these foundations, eliminate friction at the start of every project, and maintain momentum through proper project scaffolding, configuration, design patterns, and workflow optimization.

## What You'll Find Here

Standalone tips and practical resources from a professional developer: setup guides, configuration templates, design patterns, workflow tips, and strategies for building solid foundations. Each resource is designed to be consumed independently and help you establish foundations that make vibecoding easier, enabling longer, more effective work sessions and helping you stay in the flow.
