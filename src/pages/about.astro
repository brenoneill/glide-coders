          Hi, I'm Brendan O'Neill. Glide Coders provides standalone tips from a professional developer to help vibecoders 
          minimize dev friction. Each resource is self-contained and actionable, designed to eliminate friction when 
          starting new projects so you can focus on building instead of configuring.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title text-2xl font-serif font-medium mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100">What is Vibecoding?</h2>
        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Vibecoding is about finding your flow state—that sweet spot where you're fully engaged, productive, and in the zone. 
          It's coding with intention, clarity, and momentum. But too often, starting a new project means wrestling with setup, 
          configuration, and boilerplate instead of diving into the actual work.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title text-2xl font-serif font-medium mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100">The Mission</h2>
        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          We believe the best code gets written when developers can glide smoothly from idea to implementation. 
          Glide Coders provides standalone tips and resources from a professional developer—each one self-contained 
          and actionable—to help vibecoders eliminate friction at the start of every project, from project scaffolding 
          and configuration to best practices and workflow optimization.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title text-2xl font-serif font-medium mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100">What You'll Find Here</h2>
        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Standalone tips and practical resources from a professional developer: setup guides, configuration templates, 
          workflow tips, and strategies for maintaining momentum. Each resource is designed to be consumed independently 
          and help you get from zero to productive as quickly as possible, so you can stay in the flow.
        </p>
