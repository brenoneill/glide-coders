              Hi, I'm <strong>Brendan O'Neill</strong>, a Senior Software Developer with 5 years of experience. I've built several 
              apps in both professional and startup settings. Through this experience, I've seen how small 'professional' coding 
              habits and concepts can extend the 'code-gen' life of an app. I want to help vibecoders get working apps up and 
              running by sharing these techniques and patterns.

        <h2 class="section-title text-2xl font-serif font-medium mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100">What is Glidecoding?</h2>
        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed italic">
          The practice of applying <span class="text-pink-600 dark:text-pink-400">simple but effective</span> coding techniques 
          to minimize friction when coding with AI assistants.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Glidecoding is about finding your flow state when working with AI coding assistants—that sweet spot where you're 
          fully engaged, productive, and in the zone. It's coding with intention, clarity, and momentum. But too often, 
          working with AI assistants means wrestling with prompts, context management, and code quality instead of diving 
          into the actual work. Good foundations with solid design patterns make glidecoding easier and enable longer, 
          more effective work sessions.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title text-2xl font-serif font-medium mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100">The Mission</h2>
        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          We believe the best code gets written when developers can glide smoothly from idea to implementation with AI assistants. 
          Glide Coding provides standalone tips and resources from a professional developer—each one self-contained and actionable— 
          to help you practice glidecoding, build solid foundations, eliminate friction when coding with AI, and maintain momentum 
          through proper techniques, design patterns, and workflow optimization.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title text-2xl font-serif font-medium mt-10 mb-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100">What You'll Find Here</h2>
        <p class="text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Standalone tips and practical resources from a professional developer: techniques for working effectively with AI assistants, 
          setup guides, configuration templates, design patterns, workflow tips, and strategies for building solid foundations. 
          Each resource is designed to be consumed independently and help you establish practices that make glidecoding easier, 
          enabling longer, more effective work sessions when coding with AI.
